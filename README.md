# Download Calculator
This is a simple console calculator that helps you calculate the time after which your game or application will load.
# Life is getting easier!
When downloading a game or program from a source where the download time is not displayed, you wonder: "When is this shit going to download!?".
Of course, you can do all the calculations yourself, but if you are too lazy, you can always use this calculator. Enter the speed and the remaining volume and the program already gives the result. 
There is also support for two languages English and Russian.
